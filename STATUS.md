## 2026-07-08 — TS rewrite through Phase 5 (all jobs ported)

**State:** The Python → TypeScript rewrite (`ts/`) is **functionally complete through
Phase 5**. The scheduler brain, Discord listener, daily scheduler CLI, and all 5 jobs
are ported to TS and route Court Reserve access through the `courtreserve-api` HTTP
service (no Playwright in this repo). **The live Python is still the system of record —
nothing has been cut over yet.** Only **Phase 6** (launchd → node, shadow-run, delete
Python) remains. Plan: [`docs/TS-REWRITE-PLAN.md`](docs/TS-REWRITE-PLAN.md).

### ✅ Done (merged to `main`)
- Phases 0–3: scaffold, CR HTTP client, recommender/policy/history (parity-tested), LLM
  ranker + `!book`/`!move` parser.
- **Phase 4** — Discord listener (`ts/src/discord/`). Live-verified in test channel
  `1511935694107312179`: `!help`, `!book`→preview, `!move`→preview, `cancel`, approval
  routing. REST polling (no privileged `MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent); no browser lock.
- **Phase 5** — scheduler CLI + all jobs (`ts/src/scheduler.ts`, `ts/src/jobs/`):
  `runScheduler` (recommendLlm→post→pending), `fetchHistory`, `fixImbalance`,
  `checkWaitlists`, `checkinPast`. `!schedule` spawns the TS CLI now.
- **courtreserve-api** endpoints added + merged: `GET /waitlists`, `GET /checkin/scan`,
  `POST /checkin`. Service runs as launchd `com.wmpc.courtreserve-api` on `:8787`.
- All TS: **75/75 tests, typecheck clean.** Each piece verified live against the running
  service, EXCEPT the two deliberate mutations (below).

### ⏳ In flight
- (nothing mid-merge — all session PRs are merged)

### 🔜 Next
- **Phase 6 — cutover (the only remaining phase).** Point `ops/*.plist` at `node`,
  shadow-run TS `--dry-run` beside the live Python for a week and diff daily recs
  (`npm run recommend <date> --llm` is the diff tool), then cut launchd over job-by-job
  and **delete the Python** + venv + requirements.txt.
- **Court-aware `/move`** — the last endpoint gap ([#21](https://github.com/notronwest/CourtReserve-Scheduler/issues/21),
  open). TS `!move` changes time only; a requested court change is surfaced, not applied.
- **Manual mutation tests** (never auto-run — they hit real Court Reserve):
  - `!book … confirm` in the test channel → a real booking (use a throwaway slot).
  - `cd ts && npm run checkin-past -- --event <id> --execute` → first live check-in.
- **Housekeeping:** close superseded PR
  [#12](https://github.com/notronwest/CourtReserve-Scheduler/pull/12) (import-based extraction,
  superseded by the rewrite) and stale docs PR
  [#1](https://github.com/notronwest/CourtReserve-Scheduler/pull/1).

### 🖥️ Picking up on another machine
1. `cd ts && npm install`. Copy `ts/.env.template` → `ts/.env` and fill in: `CRAPI_URL`
   (+`CRAPI_KEY` from the `courtreserve-api` service `.env`), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and the
   Discord bot token + a **webhook bound to the channel you poll** (they must match —
   `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` == the webhook's channel).
2. `npm test` (mocked — no services needed). `npm run health` checks the CR service.
3. Read-only smoke: `npm run recommend <date> --llm`, `npm run checkin-past -- --dry-run`,
   `npm run check-waitlists -- --dry-run`.
4. The `courtreserve-api` service must be running (launchd `com.wmpc.courtreserve-api`,
   `:8787`) for anything hitting Court Reserve. Restart it with
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.wmpc.courtreserve-api`.
